          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I began my journey into software development as a Web Developer and Designer by
            tinkering around with banners, wallpapers and forum signatures. Furthermore, I have
            personal and e-commerce websites for friends and small business owners utilizing popular
            web technologies. When Web Development became stale (...before JavaScript was a thing
            and made Web Development exciting again) I took my career in another direction by
            obtaining a formal education in Computer Science where I learned object-oriented
            programming languages. With these newly acquired skills I was able to create dynamic,
            interactive web and mobile applications. My recent professional experience was spent at
            IBM Security as a Staff Software Engineer developing their Identity and Access
            Management software. These days I am currently working on developing my iOS app,
            DokoDemo, which helps users find all Japanese-related events, food and news in their
            local area. I also recently took on a full-time job in Silicon Valley as a Software
            Engineer and have been actively learning Python and Django.
