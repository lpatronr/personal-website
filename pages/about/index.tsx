          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I began my journey into the world of programming and developing applications when I was
            little. I got introduced to a book titled &quot;Programming in Basic&quot; and made an
            effort to follow through. Needless to say, my motivation plummeted... Heh, that was
            expected. I decided I wanted to start with a higher-level language. A period of almost 2
            years was spent with Java, where during that time, I made the switch from C++ to C# and
            back to Java, as my interest in using new paradigms was always lurking. Even though I
            continued to solely solve algorithms and create basic programs in the terminal, I hoped
            there was some way for me to be able to see an application behind my code. Not being a
            fan of JavaScript due to its lack of a type system, I decided to investigate any
            alternative. In the following weeks, I developed a deep affection for TypeScript. The
            simplicity of the language, with both a great, broad ecosystem and a lovely syntax, made
            the prospect of developing large, complex, server-side applications with little ceremony
            something I was eager to try. Also, being able to seamlessly switch between different
            backend and frontend technologies in a workflow was one of the main selling points for
            me. Ever since, my devotion for web development has only grown.
